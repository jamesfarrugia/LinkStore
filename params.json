Got tired of saving in reddit, +1 on google+, upvoting on HN, etc...\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nWhile wondering around on the internet it is easy to come along numerous interesting articles, projects, comments, etc.  The issue I had was that it started getting out of control and though maybe reddit upvotes, HN upvotes and google keep for all other links would be enough.  Sadly, no.  So I'm writing a little application where I'll dump all current and future links into a (hopefully) organiser store.  Also note:  I typically work in Java environments so I'm ok at that, _however_ I'm using this as an excuse to force myself to learn ReactJS.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
